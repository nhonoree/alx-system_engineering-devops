# What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

## Introduction
When you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events takes place behind the scenes to deliver the Google homepage to your screen. In this blog post, we’ll break down each step of this process, from the initial DNS request to the final rendering of the page.

## 1. DNS Request
The first step is to resolve the human-readable domain name (`www.google.com`) into an IP address that computers can understand. This process is called **DNS resolution**.

1. Your browser checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for `www.google.com`.
2. If not found, the browser queries the operating system’s cache.
3. If still not found, the request is sent to a **DNS resolver** (usually provided by your ISP).
4. The resolver queries the **root DNS servers**, which direct it to the **Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers** (e.g., `.com`).
5. The TLD servers point to the **authoritative name servers** for `google.com`, which return the IP address.
6. The IP address is cached for future use.

## 2. TCP/IP
Once the browser has the IP address, it establishes a connection to the server using the **TCP/IP protocol**.

1. The browser initiates a **three-way handshake** with the server:
   - **SYN**: The browser sends a synchronization packet to the server.
   - **SYN-ACK**: The server acknowledges the request and sends a synchronization packet back.
   - **ACK**: The browser acknowledges the server’s response.
2. Once the connection is established, data can be transmitted between the browser and the server.

## 3. Firewall
Before the request reaches the server, it passes through a **firewall**, which acts as a security barrier.

1. The firewall inspects the incoming request to ensure it complies with security rules.
2. If the request is allowed, it is forwarded to the server. Otherwise, it is blocked.

---

## 4. HTTPS/SSL
To ensure secure communication, the browser and server use **HTTPS** (HTTP over SSL/TLS).

1. The browser sends a request to establish a secure connection.
2. The server responds with its **SSL certificate**, which contains the public key.
3. The browser verifies the certificate with a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.
4. Once verified, the browser and server exchange encryption keys.
5. All communication is encrypted using **symmetric encryption**.

## 5. Load Balancer
Google uses **load balancers** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.

1. The load balancer receives the request and decides which server to forward it to.
2. It uses algorithms like **round-robin**, **least connections**, or **IP hashing** to distribute traffic evenly.

---

## 6. Web Server
The request reaches a **web server** (e.g., Nginx, Apache), which handles static content.

1. The web server receives the request.
2. If the request is for static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS), the web server serves it directly.
3. If the request requires dynamic content, it is forwarded to the **application server**.

---

## 7. Application Server
The **application server** handles the business logic and processes dynamic requests.

1. The application server executes the necessary code (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
2. It interacts with the **database** to retrieve or store data.
3. It generates a response (e.g., HTML, JSON) and sends it back to the web server.

---

## 8. Database
The **database** stores and retrieves data required by the application.

1. The application server sends a query to the database (e.g., SQL or NoSQL).
2. The database processes the query and returns the requested data.
3. The application server uses this data to generate the final response.

---

## 9. Response Journey
The response travels back to your browser:

1. The application server sends the response to the web server.
2. The web server forwards it to the load balancer.
3. The load balancer sends it back through the firewall.
4. The encrypted data is transmitted over HTTPS to your browser.
5. The browser decrypts the data and renders the page.

## Conclusion
Understanding what happens when you type a URL into your browser is essential for anyone working in tech. From DNS resolution to database queries, each step plays a crucial role in delivering the content you see on your screen. By mastering these concepts, you’ll be better equipped to build, optimize, and troubleshoot web applications.
